# PEC Results

## s1 — Overall: **3.333**

- Scores: {"Relevance": 4, "Depth": 3, "ConceptAccuracy": 4, "NonDisclosure": 2, "Clarity": 4}
- Questions:
  - What is the base case for the recursive factorial function?
  - How does the recursive call work in the factorial function?
  - Can you explain the loop invariant in the context of this recursive function?
  - What happens when the input to the factorial function is zero?
  - Why is it important to consider the data structure used in the recursive call?
- Justification: The student's code is mostly correct but lacks some depth in understanding the concept of recursion and the loop invariant. The base case is missing, and the recursive call is not explained clearly. Additionally, the function does not handle negative inputs properly.

## s2 — Overall: **4.0**

- Scores: {"Relevance": 4, "Depth": 4, "ConceptAccuracy": 4, "NonDisclosure": 4, "Clarity": 4}
- Questions:
  - What does the loop invariant mean in this code?
  - How does the control flow affect the execution of the loop?
  - Can you explain why the function returns False when it should be True?
  - What happens to the loop variable 'i' after the loop completes?
- Justification: The student's code is well-structured and follows the expected logic for checking if a list is strictly increasing. However, the code could be more concise and easier to understand. Additionally, the student did not provide any explanations or examples to support their reasoning.

## s3 — Overall: **3.583**

- Scores: {"Relevance": 3, "Depth": 4, "ConceptAccuracy": 4, "NonDisclosure": 3, "Clarity": 4}
- Questions:
  - What does the function `s` do?
  - How does the function iterate over the input list `a`?
  - What condition is used to check if an element is even?
  - Why is the variable `s` initialized to 0 before the loop starts?
  - What happens when the loop encounters an odd number?
  - What is the purpose of the `return` statement at the end of the function?
- Justification: The student's code correctly implements the logic to sum even numbers in a list. However, there are some improvements that can be made to enhance clarity and depth. The function name `s` could be more descriptive, and the comments could be improved to explain the purpose of each step. Additionally, the use of a loop to iterate over the list could be simplified by using a generator expression.
